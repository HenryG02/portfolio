# portfolio
In this repository, all the files and code notebooks of my portfolio, available in https://sites.google.com/view/henry-goya, will be stored and available for reference

In my portfolio, there are three projects: 
- Development of a machine learning model in Python that performs well at predicting customer churn, using a real dataset of an Iranian Telecom company;
- Development of a deep learning model in Python, using TensorFlow, that can correctly classify handwritten digits both from the MNIST dataset and from my own handwritten digits (files available in the repository as Model Testing - X);
- Exploratory data analysis in SQL using data of different countries
