# portfolio
In this repository, all the files and code notebooks of my portfolio, available in https://sites.google.com/view/henry-goya, will be stored and available for reference

In my portfolio, there are three projects: 
- Development of supervised machine learning models in Python, using scikit-learn, that predict customer churn, using a real dataset of an Iranian Telecom company. The trained models (logistic regression and random forests) are then compared and the best option is chosen (available in https://github.com/HenryG02/customer_churn_project);
- Development of a deep learning model in Python, using TensorFlow, that classifies handwritten digits both from the MNIST dataset and from my own handwritten digits (files available in the repository as 'Model Testing - X');
- Exploratory data analysis in SQL using data of different countries

Any questions, ideas and suggestions are welcome!
