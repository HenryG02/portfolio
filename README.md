# portfolio
In this repository, all the files and code notebooks of my portfolio, available in https://sites.google.com/view/henry-goya, will be stored and available for reference

In my portfolio, there are two projects: the first one consist of the development of a machine learning model in Python that performs well at predicting customer churn, using a real dataset of an Iranian Telecom company; and the second one is a exploratory data analysis in SQL using data of different countries
